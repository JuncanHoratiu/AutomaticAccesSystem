# AutomaticAccesSystem
 This project consists of a hardware-software solution for controlling and monitoring access to a building. The system integrates both mobile application functionalities and dedicated hardware components, providing flexibility and security.

Hardware components:

ESP8266 board – used for system communication and control.

ESP32-CAM – enables video capture and streaming for access monitoring.

Electromagnetic lock (electroyală) + relay module – for physical access control.

MAX9814 microphone sensor – detects analog sound signals and triggers alerts in the application when exceeding a configurable threshold.

RFID card reader module – allows user authentication and access without the mobile app.

The mobile application complements the hardware by enabling users to manage access remotely, receive alerts, and monitor building entry events in real time.
